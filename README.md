# ScatterGather
The ScatterGather service is a software simulation of an online storage system such as OneDrive or Box. It has a basic protocol by which you communicate with it through a series of messages sent across a network. You will communicate with this service and submit and retrieve data in form of packets.

Implemented file OS operations (open, read, write, close, â€¦) that enables creation and processing of bytes data based on the commands of structured data packets made up of operation code, data block, local/remote node ID and sequence, etc.

A LRU cache is developed to speedup data transmission process, which achieved 75.04% hit rate in 10,000 operations.
